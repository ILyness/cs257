STATUS: 
This website allows easy access to find perforamnce lists and athlete results from MIAC track and field athletes. 
The home page pulls top performance lists from the selected events and seasons.
The advanced search page allows the user to search for performance lists with numerous qualifiers, ex. specific teams, meets, seasons.
The comparison tool also for specific athlete search, and opens a page with information about the individuals past performances. It also
 allows for page splitting (using the plus sign in the bottom corner) in order to pull up multiple of these athlete pages at once in 
 order to easily compare between them.

NOTES: We had a lot of fun with this and might continue it after the class. Its not perfect but very fun to play around with.
