Script to convert MIAC_data_final.csv (or a csv file matching its format) into smaller csv files to
upload into an SQL database. Those files are:

    - athletes.csv: id, last_name, first_name, gender
    - schools.csv: id, school_name
    - seasons.csv: id, season_name, season_category
    - events.csv: id, event_name, event_category, season_category
    - performances.csv: id, mark, wind, result_date, meet
    - results.csv: athlete_id, performance_id, school_id, event_id, season_id

    Adapted from Jeff Ondich's csv2tables.py from the course repository.
