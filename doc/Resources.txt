come back and fix


Thanks for sharing your API code! Here's how you can fix the team filter to support multiple teams correctly:

âœ… The Problem
You're currently doing:

python
Copy
Edit
if team:
    query = query + ''' AND schools.school_name = %s'''
    parameters.append(team)
But team = flask.request.args.getlist('team') returns a list, e.g. ["Augsburg", "Carleton"].

So appending the whole list to parameters and using = %s causes a mismatch in SQL: it tries to compare a string to a list â€” which doesnâ€™t work.

âœ… The Fix
You need to:

Dynamically insert a SQL IN clause.

Use psycopg2's parameter substitution to safely insert the correct number of placeholders.

ðŸ›  Updated Code Snippet for the Team Filter
Replace this part:

python
Copy
Edit
if team:
    query = query + ''' AND schools.school_name = %s'''
    parameters.append(team)
With this:

python
Copy
Edit
if team:
    placeholders = ','.join(['%s'] * len(team))
    query += f''' AND schools.school_name IN ({placeholders})'''
    parameters.extend(team)
âœ… Final Notes
This will now properly support URLs like:

bash
Copy
Edit
/search?team=Augsburg&team=Carleton
