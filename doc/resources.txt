    Case 1:
        
        Author: Soren 
        
        Prompt:
            Described problem with having multiple parameters come in as team and gave my query code...
            if team:
                query = query + ''' AND schools.school_name = %s'''
                parameters.append(team)
            But team = flask.request.args.getlist('team') returns a list, e.g. ["Augsburg", "Carleton"].
            So appending the whole list to parameters and using = %s causes a mismatch in SQL: it tries to compare a string to a list â€” which doesnâ€™t work.

        Response:
            âœ… The Problem
            You're currently doing:
            python
            Copy
            Edit
            if team:
                query = query + ''' AND schools.school_name = %s'''
                parameters.append(team)
            But team = flask.request.args.getlist('team') returns a list, e.g. ["Augsburg", "Carleton"].
            So appending the whole list to parameters and using = %s causes a mismatch in SQL: it tries to compare a string to a list â€” which doesnâ€™t work.
            âœ… The Fix
            You need to:
            Dynamically insert a SQL IN clause.
            Use psycopg2's parameter substitution to safely insert the correct number of placeholders.
            ðŸ›  Updated Code Snippet for the Team Filter
            Replace this part:
            python
            Copy
            Edit
            if team:
                query = query + ''' AND schools.school_name = %s'''
                parameters.append(team)
            With this:
            python
            Copy
            Edit
            if team:
                placeholders = ','.join(['%s'] * len(team))
                query += f''' AND schools.school_name IN ({placeholders})'''
                parameters.extend(team)
            âœ… Final Notes
            This will now properly support URLs like:
            bash
            Copy
            Edit
            /search?team=Augsburg&team=Carleton

        Code Implemented:
            teams = ','.join(['%s'] * len(team))
            query = query + f''' AND schools.school_name IN ({teams})'''
            parameters.extend(team)

        What I gained:
            Helped me fix a problem that i had been wokring on for a while quickly, specifically with help in SQL which is a new language as well as
            the way apis send informtaion
            Also gave me insight in how the %s function works

        What I lost:
            Admitedly, this was a problem I could have solved myself given the time and patience, and by having an LLM help me, yes it sped things up, 
            and helped sytaxically, however, I lost a chance to deepen my understanding further, by putting the extra time in to solve it myself


    Case 2:
        
        Author: Soren 

        Prompt:
            Described how I dont understand why my dropdown was auto-sizing larger than the other ones that had the same code
            my dev tools say cleint height = 80

            html line : div class="row mb-4">
                        <div class="col">
                        <label for="eventSelect" class="form-label">Event</label>
                        <select id="eventSelect" name="event" class="form-select">
                        </select>
                        </div>
                    </div>

            
        Response:

            Thanks â€” if your dropdownâ€™s clientHeight is 80px, it means the rendered <select> element is visibly too tall for your layout. This can happen due to:

            Default Bootstrap styling (.form-select) â€” it may be too padded.

            Custom user-agent styles from the browser.

            Increased line height, padding, or font size.

            âœ… To shrink the dropdown height, try one or a combo of the following CSS options:
            ðŸ”¹ Option 1: Tighter padding and font size
            html
            Copy
            Edit
            <select id="eventSelect" class="form-select w-100" style="padding: 0.25rem 0.5rem; font-size: 0.875rem

        Code Implemented:
            style="padding: 0.25rem 0.5rem; (with some tweaking to fit what i actually wanted)

        What I gained:
            Being new to HTML and bootstrap, I could not figure out how to manually fix the sizing. I looked at bootsrap examples, google,
             etc.. but nothing really helped. By using the LLM, it hlped me figure out padding was the problem, and aided me in manually 
             formatting the dropwdown.
        
        What I lost:
            Again, a chance to really dive into all the intricasies of bootstrap and html formatting
